## Tutorial for remote access
**Part 1**: Installing VScode
> Go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and read the instructions to install it onto your computer. *Make sure its the correct version!* 
<br />
Here is what it should look like after installations (may have different color, menu bar, etc. depending on systems/settings):

**Part 2**: Remotely Connecting
> If you are on a windows computer you must install [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) in order to remotely connect.
<br />
Next, look up your course-specific account for CSE15L here:
https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php
<br /> For example, mine is: *cs15lwi22axn*
<br /> Now, open a terminal on VSCode and it should look like this:
<br /> 
 
<span style="color:blue">$ ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu </span>
<br /> 
> The **zz** are replaced by letters in course specific account (ex: mine are axn).
